    <h1>AeroPy - a flight planning web application</h1>
    <h2>AeroPy</h2>
<p>What is it?
AeroPy is a small Flask app to aid the preparation of flight navigation tasks for private flying. That is; get the weather, do weight and balance checks and plan the navigation route. Not for operational use, but purely as a theme to develop my understanding of Python and the Flask web framework.

In development:
Flying Weather report, get NZCH TAF & METAR reports and plot a windrose diagram for the wind direction and strength.
Weight and Balance calculations for ZK-EBZ and check within limits defined by a plot diagram.
Currency checker (add 90days from last flight and compare with today), currency in doing manoeuvers etc.
Logbook API, for checking how many hours in a particular aircraft type or rego or how many hours flown since last BFR.
Compass turns mental maths checker
Navigation PLOG worker, (The hard one - implementing a maths wind triangle into Flask WTF-forms, working out headings, bearings, S/D/T problems.</p>
